            <p>As varied as the government response against the Covid-19 pandemic across the world has been, a common
                mitigation policy emerges: the restriction of airline travel. The public health motivation is intuitive
                enough, but to what extent is the volume of air travel positively correlated with the spread of
                Covid-19? This is the question my peers and I wanted to explore.</p>
            <p>Our main goal is to test the following hypothesis at the 5% confidence level via bivariate, multiple,
                polynomial and fixed-effects
                regression:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Null hypothesis: the number of domestic air passenger arrivals in a U.S.
                    state is not correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases in that state;</li>
                <li>Alternate hypothesis: the number of domestic air passenger arrivals in a U.S.
                    state is positively correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases in that state.</li>

            Preprocessing the data that we needed was arguably the most challenging step of the
            project, as we needed to join many data points coming from different sources. We decided to center our
            project in the U.S. because aviation and covid-19 data is relatively
            more accessible and reliable. Our data came from 3 sources:

            <p>We collected the COVID-19 data from The COVID Tracking Project, a reputable and reliable volunteer
                organization launched
                from The Atlantic that is dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the
                COVID-19 outbreak
                in the United States. Our COVID-19 sample on <span style="font-weight: bold;">the increase in positive
                    cases</span> is comprehensively large, as it includes all 50
                US states + Washington DC from Jan 2020 to Feb 2021. All we needed to do was to group by state and
                month, and then sum up the daily increase in positive cases.</p>

                of each
                state that may affect individuals' mobility going in and out of states (quarantines, state of
                emergency
                etc.) so that we can minimize the residuals of our regression models. With the start date and end date
                of each policy we encoded the data where 1 indicates that policy is active and 0 indicates that policy
                is inactive for a particular month from March 2020 till September 2020. </p>

                Department of Transportationâ€™s Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The <span

                iteneraries on a quarterly basis, and covers from Q1 to Q3 2020. The <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">T100 dataset</span> breaks down the number of passengers flying
                between
                two airports(including layovers) by month, and covers Jan to nov 2020. We combined the two datasets
                to
                estimate the number of passengers travelling between every pair of states per month, excluding
                layovers.

            <p>In the end we are able to combine the data from these 3 sources into a panel data format that is very
                useful for further analysis:</p>

            <p>While Model 1A had the highest R<sup>2</sup>, this likely reflects a spurious correlation as
                population
                is a
                confounding factor that influences both our independent and dependent variables. To control for
                population, we experimented with the percentage change(Model 1B) and per capita
                values(Model 1C) of both variables. The R<sup>2</sup> value of Model 1B is poor potentially
                because
                percentage change violates the i.i.d. assumption.</p>
            <p>We extended Model 1C by weighing the number of arrivals by the per capita new Covid-19 cases of the

            <p>All polynomial terms have significant correlation with per capita number of new Covid-19 cases at the 5%

            <p>One of the main challenges in investigating the hypothesis is the presence of substantial omitted
                variable bias, as it
                is impossible to account for all the factors that affect the number of positive covid-19 cases of
                different US states.
                Statewide public health policies, healthcare infrastructure, social/political attitudes towards the
                pandemic may be
                correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases. Additionally
                some of these
                factors might be very hard or even impossible to measure. An entity-fixed effects regression model, in
                theory,
                is able to
                control omitted variables in panel data that vary across entities (states) but not over time.</p>
            <p>The results show that the coefficient of weighted_percap and other policy variables are statistically
                insignificant at the 5% level(0.47), so we fail to reject the
                null hypothesis. The fixed-effects model yields the highest R<sup>2</sup> value
                amongst the regression models, 0.2344.</p>

            <p>Given the geographical nature of the data, a map provides a useful visualization that allows us to
                compare across different states at one glance and more intuitively understand the relationship between
                arrivals and Covid-19 cases. The map supports the results of our statistical test by showing that there
                is some positive(but limited) correlation between the independent and dependent variables.</p>

        <p class="title is-2">Conclusion</p>
        <p>According to our simple linear regression, polynomial and multiple regression models, there exists a
            statistically
            signficant positive correlation between weighted air passenger arrivals and new Covid-19 cases per capita.
            In other words, it is very unlikely to yield our sample results if the null hypothesis(no correlation
            between air travel and increase in Covid-19 cases) were true.
            However the
            independent variable explains only a small proportion of the variance in the independent variable compared
            to the dummy
            state policy variables.</p>
