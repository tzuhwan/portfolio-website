            <p>In this project I used <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">d3.js</a>, a
                powerful interactive visualization
                library,
                to create an interactive dashboard that explores a <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix
                    dataset</a> that consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Some questions that I focused on are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the top genres in terms of number of title on Netflix?
                        <ul>
                            <li>I grouped the number of
                                movies and TV shows by genre, and then filter for titles that only have
                                one single genre, such as "Documentaries", as opposed to "International Movies, Sci-Fi"
                                to
                                provide
                                clear overviews on basic genres without sub-genres. This also helped to keep the chart
                                visually neat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>How does the average runtime of movies evolve over the years?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Given the huge range of years included in the data set, I calculated the
                                average movie lengths for every 5 years from 1945 to 2020. I also provided two sorting
                                orders that users
                                can toggle to observe different patterns.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>What do the networks of actors/actresses who collaborated on movies look like?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I narrowed down the data that I needed to display by selecting only the
                                actors who acted in Dramas Films in 2018, as the cast data for all year range is too
                                massive. I picked
                                the Dramas genre because it is more likely that actors in the same genres collaborate
                                with
                                one another.
                                So each node is an actor/actress, and the movie in which they collaborate are the links
                                between them.
                                Each cluster more or less represent a movie.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

    <h2>Written Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            I chose to work with the Netflix data set. For the first question, I decided to group the number of
            movies and TV shows by the "listed_in" column, and then filter for columns that only have one single
            genre, such as "Documentaries", as opposed to "International Movies, Sci-Fi" to provide clear overviews
            on basic genres without sub-genres. This also helped to keep the chart visually neat. <br>
            For the 2nd question, given the huge range of years included in the data set, I decided to calculate the
            average movie lengths for every 5 years from 1945 to 2020. I also provided two sorting orders that users
            can toggle to observe different patterns. <br>
            For the 3rd question, I chose to narrow down the data that I needed to display by selecting only the
            actors who acted in Dramas Films in 2018, as the cast data for all year range is too massive. I picked
            the Dramas genre because it is more likely that actors in the same genres collaborate with one another.
            So each node is an actor/actress, and the movie in which they collaborate are the links between them.
            Each cluster more or less represent a movie.
        </li>

        <li>
            D3 is helpful because it simplifies a lot of computational work which would be incredibly tedious, such
            as scaling the x/y-axis, figuring the width of the bar etc. It also provides me with a great degree of
            flexibility in visualing the data in different ways without additional hassle, such as the toggle
            buttons that can sort the movie lengths differently. Lastly D3 enables me to include interactive
            elements that adds to the functionality and engagement of my data visualization, such as the tool-tip in
            the force-directed graph.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            In my opinion, transitioning from simple d3 bar charts to other forms of hierchical graphs has a steep
            learning curve, so if I were to be short on time, then d3 would not be the best tool for creating a
            visualization. Other Libraries such as Matplotlib or Tableau are likely to be easier to work with, as
            one doesn't need to be concerned with DOM manipulation etc. Secondly, D3 is not the best visualization
            tool if your goal is to visually explore the data at the start of a data project cycle, as usually one
            already has a plan/design in mind for visualizing the data already. Lastly, I think D3.js is not the
            best tool, if one doesn't have website integration in mind.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I think a group of users that may struggle understanding my data visualization is visually, especially
            with the Force-directed graph. Although I have used highly contrasting color to separate the node and
            links, the nodes and links are relatively small. The fact that the information about the actors and
            movies are displayed through hover layovers means that some physically disabled users may not be able to
            move their mouse around to explore the data. In the Betterment article by Amanda Miller, she talked
            about how tooltip labels are often difficult or impossible to do when using assistive technology.
            Instead, show the output at all times. <br>
            There is also the issue of non-responsive data visualization, which means that individuals who do not
            have a desktop/laptop will probably find it challenging to understand my graphs.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Technical constraints are definitely a key factor. As this is my first time using d3.js, there are
            elements that I find difficult to control such as margin control. I hardcoded quite a few of my margins,
            which is likely to give some users on certain devices trouble reading my data. If possible I would also
            like to share my data viz to peers who have different needs so that they can provide me meaningful user
            feedback. There are certainly shortcomings that I cannot spot on my own.
